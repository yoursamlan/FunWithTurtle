### Lets get started
## What is turtle ?
Turtle is the command based drawing tool using python. It was introduced by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s to support  his version of turtle robots, a simple robot controlled from the user's workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot's body. Turtle geometry works somewhat differently from (x,y) addressed Cartesian geometry, being primarily vector-based (i.e. relative direction and distance from a starting point) in comparison to coordinate-addressed systems such as PostScript. As a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic of the turtle robot. The turtle is traditionally and most often represented pictorially either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon).

Today, the Python programming language's standard library includes a Turtle graphics module. Like its Logo predecessor, the Python implementation of turtle allows programmers to control one or more turtles in a two-dimensional space. Since the standard Python syntax, control flow, and data structures can be used alongside the turtle module, turtle has become a popular way for programmers learning Python to familiarize themselves with the basics of the language.

Turtle module is coming pre-installed from Python 2.6+ and 3.6+ respectively.

## Basic Operations

### turtle.forward()
turtle.forward() is the main tool of turtle. As the name suggests, it helps to draw  straight line in forward direction. To draw a straight line of certain length (say l px), we have to put "1" inside the bracket.
Example: ```turtle.forward("100")``` will generate 100 px long straight line in forward direction.
